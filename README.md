# Find Your Temperature

### A weather app developed with JavaScript, HTML & CSS to demonstrate the ability to retrieve the 5-day forecast from a user's inputted zip code from the Weather Underground API. jQuery was used as well.

### The app also uses Geolocation to locate the user's current location to deliver their local temperature & current weather condition.
